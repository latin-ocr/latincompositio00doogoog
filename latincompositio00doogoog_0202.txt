In three of its uses it is followed by the indicative and in three

by the subjanetive.

1. Defining the time of the principal verb3 purely
temporal, not descriptive3 especially in the combina-
tions οδ tempore cum, οὸ die cum, nune cum, filim cum,
nuper cum, tum cum, diu est cum, and the like.

2. Cum: when suddenly. The preceding clause
then begins with vix (hardly), iam (already), or non
dum (not yet), or an adverb of similar value, the
effect of the whole being the emphatic statement of

A. Indicative a sudden and surprising occurrence. This construe·
uses of cum. tion is called by grammarians eum inversum, because
the logical relation of the clauses is inverted, the
principal thought being expressed by the subordinate
clause: hardly had I begun to speak, when suddenly
he entered, vix loqui inceperam cum (subito) ingres-us

est.

3. To express action exactly coincident with that of
the main verb. The principal and subordinate verb
are then in the same tense.
