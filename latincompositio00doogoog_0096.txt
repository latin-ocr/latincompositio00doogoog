80 LATIN COMPOSITION

of fact for which the speaker assumes all responsibility‚ the in-
dicative is employed. On the other hand, if he wishes to show
that the statement is another's (e.g. Caesar’s), a mere possibility
for which the speaker wishes to assume ‘no responsibility, the sub·
junctive must be used.

So the subjunctive in a clause dependent on a subjunctive shows
that the dependent clause is an essential part of the clause on which it
dependS, partakes of its nature, and shares in its mood. If, however,
the speaker wishes to show that the dependent clause states a fact
and is independent of the subjunctive clause, he uses the indicative.
