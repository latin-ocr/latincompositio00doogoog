282. The verb in the condition (protasis) of a condition of the
third class (contrary to fact) suffers no change in mood or tense
on becoming indirect.

283. The verb in the conclusion (apodosis) of a condition of
the third class (contrary to fact) on becoming indirect becomes
the future participle in -iirus with fuisse. Observe that the verb
in the conclusion (apodosis) shows no distinction between the
present and past forms of this condition. Such distinction is,
however, retained by the verb in the protasis, For example, in
the twosentences—

si Caesar adesset, hostes non vincerent,
si caesar adfuisset, hostes non vicissent,

’ the verbs in the conclusion, vincerent and vicissent, would both

become victuros fuisse in indirect discourse; but adesset and
adfuisset, remaining unchanged, would preserve the distinction
between 'the present and past form.
