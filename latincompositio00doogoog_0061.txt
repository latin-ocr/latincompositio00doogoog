174. Both Caesar and Ariovistus came to a certain¹ mound
to hold a conference. The German and Roman cavalry
had been so arranged that they were distant two hundred
paces from the mound. The Roman people have this cus·
tom, that they do not allow influence and rank to be taken
from those that have sought their friendship3 ²and so Caesar
demanded from Ariovistus that he should not make war
upon the Haedui nor their allieS. For it happened that
there were ancient and just reasons for 'intimate relations
between the Romans and the Haedui.
