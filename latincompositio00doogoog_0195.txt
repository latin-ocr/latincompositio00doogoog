162. causal clauses introduced by cum and qui—Res. 84, Part 1
sec.1so,1sr.

163. Quod and quia give a reason founded on fact. When the
subjunctive is used the speaker does not assign the reason as his
own, but as another’s3 and the mood depends on the principle of
implied indirect diseourse.

164. eum gives the logical reason based on the view of the
speaker or springing from the attendant circumstances, The
cause being thus viewed as a mere probability, the mood must
be subjunctive.

165. Quoniam and quando introduce as a· reason a sels-evident
or admitted fact, and naturally take the indicative. Quando is

· really a temporal conjunction and is not often used to introduce a

causal clause.

166. Cause is not infrequently expressed by a participial
clause : --

Τ lte legate kept his soldiers in camp because lte fiared the
enemy, legitus metuens hostis milites castris continuit.
