vistus. While he ¹was tarrying there a few dayS‚ the army
heard so² many rumors⁸ about the incredible valor and huge
size of the Germans‚ that great fear seized the soldiers and
disturbed their hearts not a little. Not even the tribunes of

There were some who feared that the soldiers would not
obey the command when Caesar should order them to break
up camp and march. ’
