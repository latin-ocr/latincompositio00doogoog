Fon WRITTEN TRANSLATmN—Boox ΙΙΙ. ’9

301. When the Veneti had been informed that men-of-
war were being built on the Loire, which ¹flows into the
ocean, and that Caesar 2was coming as soon as ⁸the time of
year would permit, they determined to prepare for the war
which ‘was impending. They perceived the magnitude of
the danger and how great a crime they had committed ⁶in
that they had thrown the ambassadors into chains 3 but never-
theless they were confident that the Romans, who were not
acquainted with the places⁸ where they were going to carry
on war, could not remain with them long. For they knew
the shallowS, the harbors and islandS, and had very many
ships 3 and navigation is a very different thing in an inclosed
sea and on the mighty ocean.
