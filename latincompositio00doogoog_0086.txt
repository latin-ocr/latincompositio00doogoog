ci. sec. 2 .
that afsser verbs 3)sayt'ng, thinking, and the like introduces

indirect discourse and is not expressed.

261. It is of the first importance to remember that the tense of
the infinitive in indirect discourse is determined by the tense of
the verb which it represents in direct discourse. Its tense has
nothing to do with the tense of the verb of saying on which the
indirect discourse depends, and is not affected by the laws of
tense-sequence. For example, if we have in direct discourse the
sentence —

milites fortiter pugnant,
the verb piignant, being present in tense, will be represented in
indirect discourse by the present infinitive‚ no matter what the
tense may be qs tlte verb that introduces tlte indirect discourse .· —

says
said
’ He will say that tlte soldz’ersfight (fought) bravely.
lead said
etc.

Dicit
Dixit
Dicet milites fortiter pfignire.
Dixerat ·

etc.

of indirect discourse are —-
