LESSON XXXIII

143. Clausen of characteristic—5 535. a, b (320. α, b); B. 283. 1, 23
· G. 631. 1,2; H. 591. 1 (503. I); H-B. 520, 52¹· 1. a-c.

144. When a relative clause states not a mere fact about the
antecedent (cf. see. 118), but defines it as having a certain quality
or characteristic, the subjunctive is used and we have a relative
clause of characteristic. This construction' is especially common
when the antecedent is indefinite or general and needs to be
defined. Compare the two sentences—

a. The soldier who tls-fleeing is afraid.

b. No one who flees is brave.

In a the relative clause merely states the fact that the soldier
is fleeing; in b the thought is ‘⁴ No one of such a character that
he flees is brave.” Hence the Latin ε -

a. Miles qui fugit eet timidus.

b. Nemo qui fugiat est fortia.

 

 

145. Among the indefinite and general expressions followed by
the relative clause of characteristic are the following ε -

there are some

fmus} est qui.

} who = sunt qui.

solus
