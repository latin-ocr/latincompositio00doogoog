a. To express customary or continued action in past time.

b. To describe situationS, fill in details and particulars3 while
the important forward steps in the narrative are denoted by the
perfect. ⁸

illustrated by the latter half of Chapter 7, beginning Caesar quod,
etc. The situation is described by the imperfectS, tenebat, puti-
bat, existimabat. These are all preparatory to the first decisive

and important act on Caesar’s part, expressed by the words respondit
diem se ad deliberandum siimptiirum.
