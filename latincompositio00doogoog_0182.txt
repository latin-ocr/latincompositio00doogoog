32 LATIN COMPOSITION—PART 11

LESSON XXIII 1

The Abnuve cm ‘- continued

109. The Ablative of Priee‚ Ref. 12; nannet, Ref. ῦς Quality or
characteristic, Res. 18 ; cause, Ref. ῦς with dignus and indignus, Res. 83 ’
Speoffieation, Res. 16. See also Part Ι sec. 499.

110. Distinguish carefully between the construction used after
verbs and expressions of estimation and value (aestimastis, faeere,
ducere, habere, etc.) and that used after verbs of buying and sell-
ing. The former take the genitiva· the latter the ablative: —

Voluptatem virtfis minimi facit, virtue considers pleasure of
tlte very least account.
Victoria multo sanguine stetit, the victory cost much blood.

N .Β. The only important exception to this rule is that the four
genitives tanti, quant1‚ pluris, minoris, are used after verbs of
buying and selling to express relative value.

111. English with is by no means always translatable by the
Latin cum. Cum is used only with the ablative of acccompani·
ment and the ablative of manner, and not always with them (cf.
see. 106 and 112).

112. Note the four ways of expressing manner: —

1. Celeriter currit (adverb).

2. Cum celeritate currit (ablative with cum).

3. Summi celeritate currit (ablative with an adjective).

4. Cum summi celeritate¹ currit (ablative with an adjective and
cum).

⁹113. To express emphatic cause the Latin uses, instead of the
bare ablative‚ the prepositions ob or propter with the accusative, ex,
ᾱδ, or ab with the ablative; or causi or gritii with a preceding
genitive.
