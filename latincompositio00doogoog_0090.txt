LESSON LXV

272. conditional sentences with the Indicative, or of the First elasa,
in Indireet marmurae—5 589. a (337. 1, 23 Examples 1, 2, 3); B. 319; ‹
G. 595. n. 13 656. 1, 2; 657; Η. 646 (527. I); H-B. 534. 1. b; 23 536. Ι

273. The condition (protasis) of a conditional sentence, being
a subordinate clause, regularly has its verb in the subjunctive

(cf. sec. 2⁶8).

274. The conclusion (apodosis) of a conditional sentence‚being a
principal clause, regularly has its verb in the infinitive (cf. sec. 261).

a. The only exception to this rule is when the direct form has
the imperative which would become subjunctive, or when it has
the hortative, optative, or deliberative subjunctive which would
remain subjunctive. Praetically such instances are very rare.

2⁷5. The future infinitive is used in the conclusion (apodosis)
of a future condition, and there is no distinction in indirect dis·
course between the more vivid and the less vivid form: --

Si turris moenibus adpropinquabit, legatos mittent (more vivid).
si turris moenibus adpropinquet, legatos mittant (less vivid).

Either sentence in indirect discourse becomes—
Dicit, si turris moenibus adpropinquet, eds legatos missuros esse.
