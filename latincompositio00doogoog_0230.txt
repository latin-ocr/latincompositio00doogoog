CATILINE IV

IV. ERGLlsn AUXILIARY VERBS

271. The proper translation of the English auxiliary verbs may,
can, must, mzjght, could, would, should, presents many difficul-
tieS. These arise mainly from the fact that in English these
verbs sometimes have their original and literal value, when they
must be rendered by independent verbs, and sometimes the force
of potential auxiliaries which may be expressed by the Latin
subjunctive. The ambiguity of the English often leaves the inter-
pretation open to the individual judgrnent of the translator. The,
six lessons based on this oration will be devoted to a practical
consideration of some of the most important phases of this subject.

LESSON LIX

ιιι-ΕΖ might

 

272. May and might are common auxiliaries in the translation
of some of the subordinate subjunctive constructionS,* aS‚ for ex-

ample, in purpose clauses :—
’ Catiline remained that lte mzjght kill tlte consul, Catilina
minsit ut consulem interficeret.

273. When may and might express mere possibility they are
translated by the Latin potential subjunctive ι --

You may sooner find fortune than keep it, fortunam citius
repotiis quam retineas.
You ngght have seen them fighting, videris οδε pfignanti's. .

¹⁸ The beginner is apt to make the misnke of supposing that a modal auxil-
iary must always be used in translating a subjunctive3 but see Part 1 sec. 77.
