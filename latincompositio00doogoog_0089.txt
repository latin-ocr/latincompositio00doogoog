2⁷1. Caesar says that the Aduatuci, ¹who are descended
from the Cimbri and Teutone3‚ had chosen for an abode a
place remarkably fortified by nature, since it had steep cliffs
on every side3 and that they had fortified the gentle sloping
approach which was left on one side, by a very high double
wall. Caesar‚ as soon as he arrived, commanded his (men)
'to hem in the city with a twelve-foot wall and to set up the
tower. When the enemy⁸ saw so big a machine being set
up at such a distance they laughed and said, with what

strength, pray, did men of such small stature hope to set a
tower of such weight on the wall?

1. A parenthetic clause and hence not affected by the indit. dise.
2. A command in indir. disc. after imperf). If we insert ut we have an

object clause of purpose (cf. sec. 129). The sense is practically the
same. 3. Place first.
