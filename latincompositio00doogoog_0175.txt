 

THE SYNTAX OF NOUNS 25

LESSON XIX

The Genitive Caae— continued

83. The Genitive with verbs of Feeling, Ref. 863 with rifert and
interest, Res. 6·st with Verbo of Judicial Action, Ref. 88; with Verbs of

Plenty and Want, Ref. 89.

84. The neuter of a pronoun with miseret, paenitet, etc., is not
in the genitive, but in the nominative as subject.

Ηδο pudet me, Ia'm ashamed os this (lit. this shames me).

85. The genitive with refert seems best explained as dependent on
some form of res bound up in the verb. On that theory refert Caesaris
is perhaps equivalent to rem fert Caesaris. The ablative singular ferni-
nine of the possessive (mei, tui, sui, etc.), used instead of the geni-
tive of the personal pronounS, seems to have agreed originally with the
form of res in the verb. The construction after interest follows that
of refert because of the similarity in meaning of the two verbS.

86. With verbs of judicial action the penalty is usually in the

ablative‚ less frequently in the genitive. We may, therefore, say
either eapite or capitis damnare, to condemn to death. Beware of
using morte, mortis, in this sense.

87. Most verbs of plenty and want take the ablative. Only
indigeo, want, prefers the genitive.
