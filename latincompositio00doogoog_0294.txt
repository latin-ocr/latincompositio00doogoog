EXERcrsE xxxm

A. 1. After “word had been brought to me concerning
the death of your daughter Tullia, Ι took it much to heart.
2. If 1 had been present, Ι would not have failed you and Ι
would have expressed my grief to you in person. 3. Your
friendS, who are themselves affected with equal sorrow, seem

(clearly) ‘on account of grief. 5. Consider after what man-
ner fortune has dealt‘²y with us up to this time. ’ 6. The

this time that could greatly ‘attract her to life? 8. Return·

ing from Asia, when 1 was sailing s from AEgina to Megara, I
saw the ruins of many cities, which, a few years before, had

been most flourishing. 9. ⁴111 your daughter had not ‘met
her death at this time, she ⁴⁶ would nevertheless have had to
die a few years later, since she was born mortal.⁸ 10. There
is no grief which length of time does not lessen and soften.
