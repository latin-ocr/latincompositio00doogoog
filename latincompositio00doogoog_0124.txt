424. It should be carefully noted that the various constructions
of the dative with verbs all corne under the general head of the
indirect object. Many intransitive verbs take an indirect object
and are therefore followed by the dative. Transitive verbs take
a direct object and are followed by the accusative, but sometimes
they have an indirect object or dative as well. Τ lte whole question,
then, as to whether or not a certain verb takes tlte dative dependi·
upon its capacity for governing an indirect object. Remember
that English is not a safe guide, for many verbs that are transitive
in English are intransitive in Latin, and vice versa.
