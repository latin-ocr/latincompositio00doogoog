 

THE SYNTAX OF NOUNS 27

Fon Wm‘rrsn TRANSLArroN—CHAPTER 21

92. ¹It is said that Q. Catulus said that it greatly con·
cerned the state that in Pompey's case 'no new precedent
be established; but he seems to have forgotten the many
⁸new and important precedents which had already been
established in the case of this man with his own hearty
approval and ⁴that of other influential men of the same
rank. ‘For when a mere youth and os an age much be·
low the senatorial grade, ‘military authority and an army
'were entrusted to him. And though there were some in ”
the senate who said that a ‘'man who had held no office
ought not to be sent as proconsul, he was sent and finally
was made consul before he could legally have held any
other office.

1. Latin, ‘⁴ Q. Catulus is said, etc.'’ The Latin prefers the personal
to the impersonal construction. 2. Latin, “nothing new.” 3. Latin,
“so great and so new.'’ 4. The redundant “that” in the phrase “that
of'’ is not expressed in Latin. 5. Latin, “for to him a mere youth.”
6. ‘⁶ Military authority,” one word in Latin. 7. Cf. sec. 22. 8. Le. Ιιοιιιὸ
privitus.

LESSON XXI

The Ablative Caso

93. Genera consideration, Res. 1; The amative of Separation, Ref. 14;
source, origin, material, Ref. 153 Degree of Difference, Ref. ’ἴς Compari-
σου, Res. ὃς Time, Ref. 189.

94. The presence or absence of a preposition with the ablative
of separation seems to be determined by arbitrary usage rather
than by any obvious principle of language. ln general, however,
it may be said that literal and local separation requires the prepo-
sition‚ but that where the separation is figurative the preposition
may be omitted3 and, further, that if the ablative denotes persons
i or ab is always used.
