vi PREFACE

such portions being chosen as are not usually read in second·
ary schools.· The vocabulary‚ therefore, and many of the
idioms and phraseS, will not be unfamiliar3 and students
should be encouraged to write these exercises as far as pos·
sible without consulting the special English-Latin vocabulary
with which this part has been provided.

In the preparation of this book 1 have had the criticism
and advice of many prominent teachers of secondary Latin,
and I take pleasure in acknowledging their valuable services,
Especial mention is due to Miss Bessie J. Snyder‚ of the
High School of Omaha, Neb., and to Miss Clara Allison, of
the High School of Hastings‚ Mich.
