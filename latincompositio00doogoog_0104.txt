325. The tenses of the participles are used with much greater
precision in Latin than in English. For example, in the sentences—

a. T lte captives weeping veggedfor peace.
b. C aesar hearing this was much dzlrturbed.

the English participles weeping and hearing are both present.
The Latin would use the present participle in a, but the perfect
in b; because in a the action of the participle and of the verb are
contemporaneou5‚ but in b the action of the participle is prior to
that of the verb, hence z —

a. Captivi flenffis picem petebant.
b. His auditis Caesar perturbabitur.

In short, do not use the present participle in Latin unless the
act denoted by it is contemporaneous with that of the verb on
which the participle dependS.

326. Observe that the Latin participle lacks the present pas-
sive (e.g. being seen) and the perfect active (e.g. having seen).

a. The present passive participle is supplied by a clause with
dum or cum.

b. The perfect active participle is supplied—

1. In deponent verbs by the perfect passive participle with
active meaning: Caesar, having set out— Caesar profectus.

2. In other verbs by a clause with cum or postquam or by the
perfect passive participle in the ablative absolute : —
