’ Fon WRITTEN'TRANSLATION ——Boorc IV. 21

453. Before Caesar set out for Britain he sent ahead two
men, Volusenus and Commius, who, he thought, would be
suitable for this business,¹ The one did not trust himself
to the barbarianS, but² came back in five days and reported
what he had seen. The other, (who was) faithful to him, a .
man⁸ of great⁴ valor, and (one) whose influence in these
regions was considered of great consequence, he ordered
to visit what states he could, and to announce that he
himself would come there as soon as possible, and further
to urge that‘they submit to the supremacy of the Roman
people. Meanwhile he had set out for (the country of) the
Morini, for from there the passage is the shortest for those⁸
desiring to go to the island.
