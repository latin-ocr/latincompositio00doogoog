431. The so-called special verbs that govern the dative take
this construction, not because of any arbitrary rule, but because
from the Latin point of view they are intransitive and take an
indirect object. The English meaning is not a sate guide‚ for it
sometimes happens that two Latin verbs with the same English
equivalence will be the one transitive, governing the accusative,
and the other intransitive, governing the dative. For example, the
Latin has the two verbs nocere and laedere, both translated to
injure,· but the former is intransitive and the latter transitive.
