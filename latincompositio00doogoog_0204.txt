18⁷. Tempornl Clausen wsth antequam and priusquam. —- Res. 181,
Part Ι sec. 197, 198.
188. Temporal clauses with dum, do'nec, quoad.— Ref. 188, Part Ι

sec. 202.

189. The perfect indicative with antequam and priusquam is
especially common when the main clause is negative and the main
verb in the historical perfect: hostes non prius pugni excesserunt
quam ducem concidere viderunt, the enemy did not cem-esrom battle
before they saw their leaderfall. ‘

190. The indicative in a clause with antequam and priusquam
states an actual occurrence3 a subjunctive, on the other hand,
sh'ows that the event was assumedfor purposed, but did not actually
take place at all. The sentence above (sec. 189) is a good exam-
ple of ·the force of the indicative3 but compare the following:
ante pax est facta quam telum coniceretun peace was made before
a weapon was thrown. Here the implication is that the weapon
was not thrown, and the subjunctive is used.
