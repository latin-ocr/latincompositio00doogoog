68 LATIN COMPOSITION—PART 11

232. The usual verbs of saying introducing a direct or an
indirect quotation are ᾱῑοῦ, iio, and inquam. These verbs are
used as follows:—

(1ῐοῦ regularly stands before its expression, and is followed by
either direct or indirect discourse. When the dependent clause
is negative nego should be used, not (1ῐοῦ ιιδιι.

iio is usually followed by indirect discourse, and may stand
before or after or be inserted in the expression. The subject of
iio regularly stands immediately before it, and should not be sepa·
rated from it. ”

Sometimes ἰὶδ introduces direct discourse, especially in the
proverbial ιιι iit, as Ite says,· ιιι liunt, as they say. (Cf. Cic. in
Cat. 1 ς 15.)

induam (which has the force of the perfect as well as of the
present) is used only with direct discourse and is always inserted in
the quotation. The subject of inquam usually stands directly after
it. “ ubi,” inquit Caesar, “ sunt mffitesP’ “where are my soldiers?”
said Caesar.
