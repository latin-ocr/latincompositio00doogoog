not so expressed already. For example, to translate Coesar must
give the szjgnah we first recast to tlte szjgnal must be given by

335. Bear in mind that the gerundive of an intransitive verb is
neuter (impersonal), and that the object, if there be one, will be

'used in Caesar after the verbs curii, ᾱὸ, and trado.
