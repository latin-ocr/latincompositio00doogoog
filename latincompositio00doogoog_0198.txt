48 LATIN COMPOSITION— PART 11

possible'with relatively little difference in meaning. The follow·
ing distinctions are of some practical value :—

ι. Verbs of happening are regularly followed by the subjunc-
tive with ut or ut n6n3 but if modified by bene or male or an
adverb of similar meaning, a substantive clause with quod fol-
lows (cf. sec. 171. 2), or rarely an infinitive with subject accusa·
tive ε -

It happened that Caesar was present, accidit ut Caesar adesset.
It happened sortu-

nately that Caesar}opport1'1ne accidit{
was present

quod Caesar aderat.
caesarem adesse.

2. The demonstratives hoc, illud, id, are followed—

a. By a quod-clause of fact with the indicative (see sec.
171.1). '

b. By an ut· or nei-clause with the subjunctive.

c. By an infinitive clause.

As for the choice between b and c, observe that the construction
to be· used is determined by the nature of the principal verb.
The presence of the demonstratives has no effect upon the con-
struction. For example, in I urge this upon you, that you do not
lose courage, the principal verb hortor shows that the subjunctive
is to follow (hortor te hoc, ne animum demittis). On the other
hand in I percez’ve this, that you are lesing courage, the principa]
verb intellego shows that the infinitive is to follow (hoc intellego,
te animum demittere), ’

3. accedit, it is added, is followed by either a quod-clause or an
ut-clause, with the general distinction that the quod-clause adds a
fact already known, while the tit-clause adds a new proposition
which may or may not be a fact. Practically accedit ut is the
more common.

4. quid quod, what qs the fact that, is followed by the indica-
tive (cf. sec. 160. a).
