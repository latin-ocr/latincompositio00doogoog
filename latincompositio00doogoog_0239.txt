THE ARCHIAS

V. PREPosl'mons

NOTE. —The following six lessons are devoted to the rendering of
some of the more troublesome English prepositions. The Latin and
English idionis differ nowhere, perhaps, so much as here; and nowhere
is greater care necessary.

LESSON LXV
about Q against among

 

 

 

297. about in the sense of concerning is rendered by ᾱδ and
the ablative :—

 

The ambassadors spoke about peace, legati ᾱέ pice dixerunt.

about referring to time is rendered as follows: -

about meaning in the neighborhood of (but somewhat re-
moved) by circi or circiter with the accusative.

about meaning towards, getting close t0, by sub (sometimes
ad) with the accusative.

about meaning during, taking out a part, before the end os,
by de with the ablative.

Compare the three expressions circi secundam libram — sub noc-
tem -ᾱδ tertii vigilii.

298. Q is generally rendered by post with the accusative.
after of immediate succession is rendered by ὅ or ex with the
ablative : —
