Fon WRITTEN TRANSLATION—CHAPTER 5

Ν.Β. Before writing this 'exercise‚ review thoroughly the rules for
word-order given in the first four lessons of Part Ι.

15. ¹Can you not, fellow·citizenS, defend the great² repu-
tation of your sovereignty handed down to you by your an-
cestors, who were not indifferent to the infringement of
their libertieS, but, when⁸ the right of ambassadors was vio-
lated merely by an (insolent) word, desired to destroy Cor-
inth, the ornament of entire Greece? ⁴How long will you
permit this king to ἕοὅ unpunished, who has slaughtered
thousands of our citizens and allies and has punished an
ambassador of the Roman people with every kind of tor-
ture? Now all the states in all Asia and Greece ⁴'cherish
this same desire ε (namely,) ''that you dispatch the one man
by whom the attackslof the enemy can be stayed.

1. Question introduced by nonne. 2. Latin, ‘⁸ so great.” 3. Latin
“because ’' or “since’' 4. quam diu. 5. Latin “be.'’ 6. Latin, “wish

LESSON V

Agreement of Adiectives — continued

16. Latin often uses an adjective agreeing with the subject or
object, where our idiom requires an adverb modifying the verb : e.g.

I heard him glad& laetus eum audivi.
I or . }becomes{(l‚ glad, heard him.)
was glad to hear lum
This adverbial use is exemplified especially with —
a. Adjectives of feeling or emotion, as laetus, libens, timidus,
maestus, invitus, ete.
b. Adjectives of manner or description, as sciens, insciens, prii-
ᾱδιιει, ete.
