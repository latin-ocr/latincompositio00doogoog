second sentence Ad eum is placed first because referring to the l
preceding subject. Compare also the order of T lte bravest os all
these are tlte Belgians and the Latin Horum omnium fortissimi Ι
eunt Belgae. This principle explains the use and position of such

rebus cognitis, etc.

positiqe). The vocative case rarely stands first.
