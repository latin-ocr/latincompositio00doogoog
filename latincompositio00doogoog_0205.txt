FOR WRITTEN TRANSLATION—CHAPTER 4

194. After all the citizens saw that a conspiracy had been
openly made, and when there was no one at Rome, over-
whelmed with debt‚ who had not joined¹ this incredible
league of crime, the consul thought that there was no longer
room for mildness and that all corrupt and infamous charac-
ters must be cast out. Catiline had already set out ; but as ,
long as the other assassins who lived on intimate terms with
him remained, the commonwealth could not be ²restored to
health. The consul, therefore, pointed out the way, and
commanded all to depart. “If you are willing to hasten‚''

⁸said he, ‘⁴ you will overtake Catiline before he reaches* the
camp of Manlius.’'

ι. Latin, ‘⁶ added himself t0.” 2. levare. 3. inquit. 4. pervenire.
