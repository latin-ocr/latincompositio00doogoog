304. Observethat the Latin present infinitive must sometimes
be translated by an English past; for example,—

Dicit se venire is translated he says that lte is coming,
but
Dixit εδ venire is translated he said that lte was coming.

305. In deciding what tense of the infinitive should be used
in an indirect statement‚¹ it is a good plan to make the indirect
statement direct. Then— ’

a. A present indicative of the direct becomes present infinitive
in the indirect.

b. Any past tense of the indicative becomes perfect infinitive.

c. A future indicative becomes future infinitive‚ or, if the verb
be passive or laek the future participle, fore (futurum esse) ut'
with the subjunctive.

To illustrate: lte said that lte would come is an indirect state·
ment.> The direct form, i.e. what he said in his own word3‚ waS‚
I will come. This is the future indicative and would become

the future infinitive in the indirect form : hence, dixit se venturum
me· .
