Fon WRITTEN TRANSLATION—CHAPTER 4

131. ¹Can you deny, Catiline, that you and certain
others whom I see here in the senate were at Laeca’s night
before last? But where in the world are we, when 1, the
consul, ask the opinion on public affairs of men who at
that very time are plotting the destruction of us all? Ι
found out that very night, Catiline, how you had apportioned
the parts of Italy3 whom you had selected ²to leave at Rome ;
whom to take with you. And when Ι heard that two Roman
knights had been found who promised to kill me that very
night, Ι fortified my house and shut them out when they
came early in the morning to salute me.
