224. ΤΙιε enemy waited for a long time (to see) if Caesar
would cross the swamp, but after he had led his troops back
into camp they hastened to the Axona ¹for the purpose of
destroying the bridge. Since, however, they could neither
take-the city nor cross the river, ²it was discussed in a council
whether it was best to return home or to rem-ain longer. We
know why 'the Bellovaci could not be persuaded to remain,
and there was the added fact that provisions had begun to fail.

1. Latin, ‘⁶ with this purpose, that they might destroy.” 2. deliberi-
tum est. 3. Follow the text. '

LESSON LIII '

225. conditional sentences. General &nements—5 512, 5¹ 3, 5¹4·

226. conditional sentences with the Indicative. -ἓ 5¹ 5. a; 516. 1. a

227. In dealing with conditionS, the first thing to be determined
is the ΤΙΜΕ. The English is often misleading, owing to the fact
that the tense used and the real time denoted by it are not always
the same (cf. sec. 71). Compare the two sentences :—

a. If this is a state, 1 am a citizen.

b. tf the general arrives, he will conquer.

In a the tense used and the time are both present,· but in b the
present arrives is really future in time, as is shown by the verb
will conquer in the conclusion. It is to be observed—

1. That Latin always translates tlte real time of the English
verb rather than the tense in which it may appear.
