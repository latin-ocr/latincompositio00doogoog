LESSON III

10. Agreement of Adjectiveo. —- Res. 27.

11. When an attributive adjective is used with two or more
substantive-⁶„ it agrees with the nearest, and may be placed before
or aster the first substantive or after the last: —

flulti filii et filiae
mii multi et filiae ,}many sons and daughters.
mii et filiae multae

But not before the last-—
mii et multae filiae—

for in that case multae would be understood as belonging to
filim alone.
