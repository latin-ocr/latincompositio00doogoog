Fon WRITTEN TRANSLATloN—-CHAPTER 13

> 177. ¹Although the consul knew that ²wicked citizens
had banded themselves together to destroy the city, yet he
did not think best to kill Catiline, because he feared that
8if Catiline alone should be removed, the disease of the com-
monwealth, relieved for, a short time by his punishment,
would become worse, the remainder being alive. He there·
fore *strongly urged this, that Catiline depart from the city
with all his followers and separate himself from the ²loyal
citizens. He promised further that on Catiline’s departure
there would be such courage in all, that all things would be
brought to light and punished.
