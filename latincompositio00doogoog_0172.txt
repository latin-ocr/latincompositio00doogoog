22 LATIN COMPOSITION-PART 11

c. Qualities that lack permanence are expressed by the ablative.
This applies especially to the description of passing emotions and
feelings ε - ⁸

Bono animo est, he is of good courage.

Δ. Permanent and essential qualities may be expressed by either
the genitive or the ablative ε --
Cato singulari prudentii (or singularis prudentiae) erat, Cato
was qf remarkable sagacity.

Finally‚ it should be noted that neither the genitive nor the
ablative may stand without an attributive adjective of degree like
magnus, parvus, summus, etc.

¹73. The partitive genitive denotes the whole of which a part is
taken. Hence it is obvious that if not merely a part but the whole
is taken there can be no partitive genitive. While then we say
magna pars horum, a great part of these, using the partitive geni-
tive, we cannot say omnes horum for ALL os these, but rather omnes hi.

¹74. It is important to remember that the partitive genitive is
not used after cardinal numerals or quidam, but that ex or de with
the ablative is used instead.
