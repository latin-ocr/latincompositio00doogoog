LESSON XVII

The Genitive case

69. General Rules for the Genitive, Res. 58, Part I sec. 4043 Pos-
sensive Genitive‚ Ref. θβς Genitive of Material, Res. 693 Genitive of
Quality, Res. 64; subjective Genitive, Ref. 853 obJective Genitive,
Res. 6ος Partitive-Genitive, Ref. 61.

⁷0. A preposition with its object'often takes the place of an
objective genitive, especially when the governing noun is modified
by a possessive pronoun or by a genitive, hence—my lovesoryou,
meus in te amor rather th an meus tui amor ; the consul ’s services to
tlte country, consulis in patriam beneficia rather than consulis patriae
beneficia.

71. The subjective genitive of the personal pronouns (meI, tui,
sui, nostri, vestri) is not used. Instead of these we should use the
corresponding possessives. For example, a friend of mine should
never be rendered amicus meI, but amicus meus.

72. With reference to the genitive and the ablative of qual-
ity or description the following statements may be made: —

a. Designations of measure, number, time, wengltt‚ space, age,
and rank are regularly in the genitive:—

Fossa pedum trium, a ditch qf three feet.
Puer decem ann5rum, a bo y os ten years.

b. Descriptions of the body and personal appearance are regu·
larly in the ablative :—

Homo humili statura, a man os small stature.
