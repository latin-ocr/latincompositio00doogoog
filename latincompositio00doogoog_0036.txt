20 LATIN COMPOSITION

⁷5. The tenses ot' the subjunctive in independent clauses
denote time as follows :—

a. Present denotesfuture or indefinite time.
subjunctive {
Tenses.

b. Imperfect denotes present or past time.
c. Perfect denotes future or past time.
d. Pluperfect denotes past time.

1t will be seen that though the subjunctive has no future tenses
the future idea is inherent in both the present and the perfect
tense. When the future idea is emphatic the first periphrastic
forms are used (e.g. amaturus sim).

⁷6. The Latin subjunctive in some of its construe tions approaches
the meaning of the English potential auxiliaries: may, can, must,
magnit, could, would, should. But when these auxiliaries are literal
and emphatic they must be rendered by independent verbS, as may,
might, by licet3 can, could, by possum3 should by deheii, etc.

⁷7. Many subjunctive constructions are translated by the Eng-
lish indicative and show no special form or modal auxiliary. In
such cases, therefore, there is nothing in the English to show that
the Latin subjunctive must be used: e.g. scio quid fadis, I know
what you are doing,· tanta erat tempestas ut nives dispellerentur,
the storm was so great that the ships were scattered.

78. The subjunctive is used in independent sentences to
express—

1. An exhortation or command (Hortatory or Volitive). Nega-
tive is ne.

2. A wish or desire (Optative). N egative is ηδ.

3. A rhetorical question expressing doubt or indignation (Delib-
erative). N egative is non.

4. A possibility (Potential). N egative is non.

79. The Hortatory Subjunctive in its usual form is in the first
or third person of the present tense, and is introduced in English
by let. When expressing a command it is sometimes called the
jussive (cf. iubeo) subjunctive.
