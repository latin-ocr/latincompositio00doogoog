28 LATIN COMPOSITION—PART 11

95. It should not be forgotten that some verbS, compounds oi
ab, (16, or ex, take the dative (especially of a person) instead of the
ablative of separation.

96. Verbs oi plenty and want usually take the ablative (cf.
sec. 87). With verbs of plenty the ablative may be classified as
meam, with verbs of want as separation. The commonet verbs
of plenty and want are—

abundire, b d . privare,

redundare, }a mm ἠ’ spoliare, }dcprive of.
complere, exuere,

explere, } fill with. carere, lack.

implere, vacare, be without.

egere,
indigere, }nCCC{-.

97. The ablative of degree oi difference is especially common
after the adverbs ante, post, infra, supra, and is often expressed
by the neuter ablatives multo, paulo, nihilo, tanto, quanto, eo, hoc,
quo.

98. The ablative aster comparatives without quam comes under .
the head oi the ablative of separation. Such a sentence as nihil est
melius virtute means literally, from virtue (as a standard) nothing
is better. The construction is admissible only when the first oi
the objects compared is in the nominative or accusative.

a. A relative standing after a comparative is always in the'
ablative: quam is never used. Hence :—

Reus-on, than wltt'clt nothing is more godlike‚ ratio, qui nihil
est divinius.
N ever ratio, quam quae nihil, etc.

99. Latin uses the ablative of time in many expressions which
according to our idiom seem locative3 for example—

In tlte Punic war, bello Punico.
At tlte Roman games, Isidis Romim‘s.
