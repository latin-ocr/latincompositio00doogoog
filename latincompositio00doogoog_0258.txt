108 LATIN COMPOSITION—PART 111

B. For many reason3‚ Cicero's orations against⁰ VerreS,
in which he gives aa full account of the latter's shameful
acts committed against the Sicilians‚ are ¹2⁶worth reading3
for it must be confessed ‘that he was⁹⁸ the most corrupt
propraetor that ever ruled over a province. These orationS,
moreover, show us not alone the evils by which the Roman
state was affected at that time, but also the patriotism with
which the distinguished orator was filled. And he took the
part of prosecutor with ⁹such zeal 12²that Verresd decided¹³⁶
to go into ²¹²(voluntary) exile.

a. in. b. Latin, “in many words.'’ c. Latin, “that he among all
propraetors who have ever ruled over a province was the most cor-
rupt.'' d. ille.

EXERCISE 11

A. 1. Sulpicius ⁷⁹ was exceedingly vexed ”because Cicero
⁹⁷ had forgotten his friendship,⁷⁰ and was defending Murena
against him.¹¹⁵ 2. It is a “serious matter to be justly⁶
accused in ³¹¹(a case of) friendship3 and ⁸⁷ even if you are
falsely accused, ⁹⁹it ought not to be regarded lightly.
3. Murena was born of a distinguished and honorable
plebeian family,¹⁶ at Lanuvium,¹⁰1 a Roman ‘municipal town.
4. ⁴⁰1f “my intimacy with you had caused me to withdraw
from this case, the consul elect would (now) have no
defendet in that state in which our ancestors intended that
‘no one,⁴⁷ however low, should ever want¹³² an advocate.
5. I should consider myself arrogant, gentlemen of the

jury, ⁴⁰if s the consul had found me wanting. 6. Ι will ·

deal with you, Sulpicius, δ’ as if my brother, who is very dear
to me, were ⁴2in your* place. 7. One part of the accusation,
‘which is concerned with the life of 'Murena and which
ought ⁹⁴to have been the most serious, is the most trifling.
