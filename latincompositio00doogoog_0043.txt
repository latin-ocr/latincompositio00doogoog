104. On the next day Caesar, changing his line of march,
hastened to go to Bibracte, which was the richest city of the
Haedui and not more than eighteen miles distant, because
in two days¹ it 2w0u1d be necessary to measure out grain to
the army. The Helvetii thought that he was frightened,
and began to follow and harass ours on the rear. But
Caesar led his forces to the nearest hill, and, ⁸drawing up
his line of battle, said: “Gather the packs into one place,
and let the two legions which 1 last enrolled be stationed
on the top of yonder⁴ ridge.'’

106. The Sequence of Tenses is nothing peculiar to Latin, but
is familiar from English usage. Compare—

He fears that he may die.
He feared that he might die.

The change from may to might, owing to the change in the main
verb from seara to feared, corresponds to the change in Latin from

the present to the imperfect subjunctive. The above in Latin

would be - Timet ne moriatur.

Timebat ne moreretur.

The laws of Tense·Sequence do not apply with equal stringency
to all dependent constructions and were often disregarded.
