RULES FOR AGREEMENT 11

LESSON IX

4'0. Relative with its antecedent—5 305-306 (198, 199); Β. 2 50;
G. 6143 H. 396-399 (445); H-B. 281.a; 322, 284. 2, 3, 4.

41. In the agreement of the relative pronoun it is important to
observe that, while the pronoun agrees with its antecedent in gen-
der and in number, its case is determined by its function in the

relative clause which it serves to introduce. Note the following
examplesz—

caesar militis qui timidi erant non laudabat.
Caesar did not praise tlte soldiers who were afraid.

Here qui agrees with milites in gender and in number, but while
milites is accusative qui is nominative as subject of erant.

Milites quos videmus sunt timidi. ·

Tlte soldiers whom we see are afraid.

Here milites is nominative and quos is accusative.
Princeps eitius filius est captus picem petebat.
T lze chief whose son was captured was suz'ngfor peace.

Here princeps is nominative and cuius is genitive. Therefore, when-
ever the relative and its antecedent are in the same case, it is a mere
coincidence and not at all due to grammatical agreement.

42. A relative agrees with a predicate noun in its own clause
rather than with an antecedent of different gender and number.
Rhenus quod est ffi’unen Gallicum, tlte Rhine, which is a Gallie

stream.
