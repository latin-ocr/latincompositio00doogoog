472. When Caesar noticed that his soldiers could not
follow the standards and that men from different ships
joined whatever standard they happened upon and that the
enemy were hurling weapons on the exposed flank, he com-
manded aid to be sent to those that were hard pressed.
But as soon as the Romans stood on dry land, they put the
enemy to flight; and the only thing that was lacking to
Caesar's former good fortune was this, 1that he² had no
cavalry ”with which to pursue the enemy. After this battle
was fought ambassadors came to ask⁴ Caesar for peace, and
said that ‘he ought to pardon them because they had made
war upon him through ignorance. Caesar demanded hos-
tageS, all of whom⁸ they gave in a few days.
