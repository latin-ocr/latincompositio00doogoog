The Ablative case — continued

102. The Ablative of Agunt, Res. 4; Menas, Rei. 103 with atorg fruor,
etc„ Ref. 1⁷3 with opus and fisus, Res. 11 ; of Accompamment, Res. 8;
Place, Ref. 101, 102.

103. The person by whom something is done as the agent is
expressed by 5., ab, with the ablative.

The person through whom something is done as the instrument
is expressed by per with the accusative.

Caesar was z'nfhrmed by Labienus (agent) through messen-

gers (instrument), Caesar certior factus est 5. Labieno per
nuntios.

104. 'r'he ablative without a preposition to denote the way by
which is of frequent. occurrence in words like via, iter, porta, fifi-
men, mare, etc„ and comes under the generalhead of means or
instrument. ’

They set out by the A ppian Way, Appii via profecti sunt.

105. The usual construction with opus est is impersonal, the
thing needed being in the ablative and the person needing it in
the dative:— “

Libris mihi opus est, I need books.

But when the thing needed is expressed by a neuter pronoun or
adjective the personal construction must be used:—

Multa nobis opus sunt, we need many things (lit. many things
are necessary ‚to us). ’ ”’

Note that opus and fisus are never declined in this construction.
Usus is much rarer than opus.

106. The rule that the ablative of accompaniment may omit cum
in military expressions should be used with caution. Such omission
is allowable only when the noun is modified by an adjective other
than a numeral. We may therefore write mignIs copiis profectus
