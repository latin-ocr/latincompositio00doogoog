DEPENDENT MOODS AND TENSES 29

LESSON XXVI

110. Ροοιιιίηἱῒίοο in Tenue-Sequente. —§ 48 5. a, b, c, e, g, h (287. a, b,
c, e, s); B. 268. 1-6; G. 509. 23 H. 546-550 (495. 1-VI); H-B. 478.

111. Note that after a primary tense the perfect subjunctive
must be used to denote any past action, e.g. —

· have written. , , - .- ‚
I do not doubt that thqy ί were writing, } ⁸⁰:033OE ‘lum aen1²·
wrote.

112. The Historical Present takes either the primary or the
secondary sequence.

113. The Perfect Definite (perfect with have) takes the second-
ary sequence unless the reference to present time is very distinct.

114. The most important exception to the rules for tense-
sequence is that in Clauses of Result (Consecutive Clauses) com-
pleted action is regularly expressed by the Perfect Subjunctz've
after secondary as well as after primary tenses. However‚ if the
action is regarded as continued or incomplete‚ the Imperfect Sub-
junctive should be used here as elsewhere after a secondary tense.
